            My tunnels help aerate and turn the soil.<br/>
            that means they help oxygen get in.<br/>
            And I eat all kinds of <strong>organic matter</strong><br/>
            (which is stuff that is or was alive.)<br/>
            When I poop I add nutrients to the soil making it much better for plants.
